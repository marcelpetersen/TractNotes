## Motivation

A multi-platform Android/iOS mobile application to assist land trust organizations in monitoring open space properties. Land trusts are nonprofit organizations whose mission is to preserve open space properties. As such, they own both properties and easements over properties throughout CT. There are 137 land trust organizations in CT, and many more in New England and around the country. Monitoring these properties and easements annually is essential to ensure people are neither encroaching on them nor violating their terms. This has typically been done on paper, but land trusts have been expressing a strong interest to digitize this process.
